# Deep Learning Project 14
Final project on Causality for course 02456 Deep Learning. 

For this project, we reproduced the results of *Invariant Causal Representation Learning for Out-of-distribution Generalizations* by Lu et al. 

# How to Read the Repo 

The methods we reproduced from *Invariant Causal Representation Learning for Out-of-distribution Generalizations* can be divided into two main categories: experiments with synthetic data and experiments with CMNIST data. As such, we have divided our code into two notebooks that reflect this separation. 

[**Report_Notebook_SyntheticData.ipynb**](Report_Notebook_SyntheticData.ipynb) is a Jupyter Notebook in which you can find our code for the Synthetic Data experiments. 

[**Report_Notebook_CMNIST.ipynb**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NM7aODEao3HQZTeSCdnBBg_3yBoGicaV?usp=sharing) is a Colab Notebook in which you can find our code for the CMNIST experiments.
